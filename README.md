# Predicting House Price Using LInearRegression
This project uses Linear Regression algorithm to predict house prices. The dataset used in this project is the Housing dataset which contains information about various features of houses in Boston suburbs and their corresponding prices.The Predicting-House-Price-Using-LInearRegression is a machine learning project that aims to predict the sale price of houses based on various factors such as the number of rooms, the size of the property, the location, and other features. The project utilizes linear regression, a popular machine learning algorithm that is commonly used for regression analysis, to predict the house prices. Linear regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm that models the relationship between the dependent variable (house price) and one or more independent variables (house features) to find the best-fit line that can be used to make predictions.

This project is ideal for those who are interested in learning machine learning concepts and techniques or those who are looking to apply machine learning to real-world problems such as predicting house prices. By following this project, you will learn how to preprocess data, train a linear regression model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions. The project is written in Python and utilizes popular machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
